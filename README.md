# Tabs Section

This project is a simple tabs interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows the user to switch between different content sections by clicking on tabs that correspond to each section. The tabs and their corresponding sections are styled with CSS, and the switching functionality is implemented using JavaScript. When a tab is clicked, the active tab is highlighted, and the corresponding section is displayed while hiding the other sections. This project can be easily modified and integrated into other web pages that require a similar tabs interface.
